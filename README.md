# PMS5003 Browser using 8266 esp12e board
Based on code from 'Build Web Servers' by Rui Santos. Great eBook, enjoyed reading it - thanks Rui. And thanks to anyone else that spots thier code snippet! 
Redeveloped project using Web Sockets. For me this is a cleaner and easier to understand (and debug) way to share data between IOT devices and Browsers.
Connection details at the top of the main.cpp file. (PMS5003 TX --> ESP RX)
Next steps :- 
  Save Data to onboard flash (littleFS
  Allow user to save data some how? (email?, webpage?)
